### Component Description

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Web Interface: React-based UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
   - Next.js App Router: Handles routing and server-side operations
   - Server Actions: Processes form submissions and API calls

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Document AI Client: Interfaces with Google Cloud
   - Google Cloud Document AI: Main processing engine
   - Invoice Parser: Specialized processor for invoice extraction

3. **Data Layer**
   - Vendor Database: Stores vendor profiles and history
   - Validation Engine: Compares extracted data with records
   - Approval Workflow: Manages the review process

4. **Output Layer**
   - Structured Data: Normalized invoice information
   - Validation Results: Comparison outcomes
   - Final Decision: Approval status and actions

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Google Cloud Document AI
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Google Cloud account with Document AI API enabled
- Google Cloud credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoice-processor.git
cd invoice-processor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Google Cloud credentials:
```env
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_LOCATION=your-location
GOOGLE_PROCESSOR_ID=your-processor-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Setting up Google Cloud Document AI

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable Document AI API
3. Create a new processor (Invoice Parser)
4. Create a service account and download credentials
5. Add credentials to your `.env.local` file

## Usage
